            <p>
                This project is a strategic Go game implemented with a client-server architecture, where the server manages
                the game logic and maintains a persistent SQL database to store game data. The backend is written in Java,
                providing a scalable and efficient environment for real-time multiplayer gameplay. The client, built using
                modern web technologies, offers an intuitive interface and supports seamless interaction with the server. 
                The game ensures real-time synchronization of game state across multiple clients, making it suitable for 
                multiplayer gaming experiences.

            <p>
                This project focuses on the creation of a compiler for a simple imperative programming language. It is
                designed to convert source code into virtual machine instructions, supporting basic constructs such as variables,
                loops, and conditionals. Built using Python and the SLY library, the compiler performs both lexical and syntactic
                analysis, ensuring that the source code adheres to the language's rules. In addition, it identifies semantic errors
                and generates optimized machine code, which is then executed on a virtual machine.

                    <li>Lexical and syntactic analysis of source code</li>
                    <li>Semantic error detection to ensure correct program behavior</li>
                    <li>Generation of optimized machine code for execution</li>
                    <li>Flexible and extensible architecture for future enhancements</li>

            <p>
                Developed a real-time strategy (RTS) game using the Godot Engine, where players can manage resources, build
                structures, and control units to outsmart their opponents. The game features AI-controlled enemies with different
                levels of difficulty and a dynamic resource management system. The game mechanics, including base building, unit
                creation, and combat, were designed to provide an engaging and challenging experience for players.
