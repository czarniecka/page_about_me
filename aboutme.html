            Hello! <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i>

        </h2>


        <p class="about-me-text">
            My name is Aleksandra Czarniecka, and I am a third-year student of Algorithmic Computer Science at Wrocław
            University of Science and Technology.
            My studies combine advanced computer science with mathematics, focusing on algorithm design and analysis. I
            work with both classical and modern algorithms, various programming languages and paradigms, and
            mathematical tools for evaluating efficiency.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-text">
            I am an aspiring programmer with experience in both team and individual projects, ranging from game
            development to compiler design.
            I am constantly expanding my knowledge across multiple programming languages and technologies. My experience
            as a mathematics and chess instructor has strengthened my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and
            ability to communicate complex ideas effectively.
            Teaching has also helped me develop patience, adaptability, and the ability to break down complex topics
            into clear, understandable concepts-valuable skills in both software development and teamwork.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-text">
            Throughout my journey, I have explored a variety of programming languages- from widely used ones like
            Python, Java, and C/C++ to more niche yet fascinating ones such as Prolog or Ada.
            I enjoy delving into algorithms, solving programming and optimization challenges, and understanding how
            things work under the hood. My strong mathematical foundation allows me to approach problems with analytical
            precision.
