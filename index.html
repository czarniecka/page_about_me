            <h2>Student of Algorithmic Computer Science | Programmer</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! In a nutshell, my name is Ola Czarniecka and I’m studying algorithmic computer science at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
                Currently I am on my sixth semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am aspiring programmer with experience in both team and
                individual projects, ranging from game development to
                compiler design. Continuously expanding knowledge in
                multiple programming languages. Experience in teaching
                mathematics and chess enhances logical thinking and
                effective teamwork communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve explored numerous programming languages – from the obvious ones like
                Python, Java, and C/C++ to the more niche but fascinating ones like Prolog or Ada. I’ve
                implemented many algorithms, tackled various programming and optimization problems, and
                built a strong mathematical foundation. I understand what happens under the hood.
            </p>
